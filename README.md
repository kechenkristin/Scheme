# About The Project

## An interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language.
Robustness, light weight, easy to use, support most of scheme's features and functionalities.



## Using UCB cs61a fall 2020's project4 as skeleton and inspiration.
Pass the autotester of Berkley's autograde test framework, gain a descent grade.


## Scheme features

1. Read-Eval-Print

    Read: Parsing user input(a String of Scheme code)

    Eval: This step evaluates Scheme expressions (represented in Python) to obtain values. 

    Print: This step prints the __str__ representation of the obtained value.


2. Load

    The interpreter can evaluate the expression in an input file by passing the file name as a command-line argument.

3. Symbols

    The interpreter is case-insensitive.

4. Turtle Graphics
   
    Including procedure calls to the Python turtle package.

## Running the interpreter

To start an interactive session:

    pyhton3 scheme.py


To evaluate the expressions in an input file by passing the file name as a command-line argument to scheme.py:

    python3 scheme.py fileName.scm
    

To exit the Scheme interpreter:

    scm> (exit)
